# Woohee HF Loader

Load models directly from Hugging Face Hub in ComfyUI without manual downloads.

## Description

This custom node collection allows you to load various models (upscalers, checkpoints, LoRAs, etc.) directly from Hugging Face repositories into ComfyUI. No need to manually download and place models in your models folder - just provide the repository name and filename!

Currently supports:
- UNET models (Diffusion models, Qwen Image Layered, etc.)
- CLIP models (Text encoders, Qwen 2.5 VL, etc.)
- VAE models (Variational Autoencoders)
- Upscale models (ESRGAN, Real-ESRGAN, etc.)
- GGUF models (Quantized models for efficient inference)

## Features

- Load UNET, CLIP, VAE, upscale, and GGUF models directly from Hugging Face Hub
- Pre-configured defaults for Qwen Image Layered models
- **4-channel RGBA VAE support** with embedded WanVAE implementation
- **ComfyUI v0.3.62+ compatible** - works on older versions without updates
- **Full alpha channel preservation** for Qwen Image Layered layer decomposition
- Automatic model caching to avoid repeated downloads
- Support for both public and private repositories (with API token)
- Compatible with standard ComfyUI model formats
- Works seamlessly with all ComfyUI model nodes

**4-Channel RGBA Support:**
- Automatically detects and supports 4-channel RGBA VAE models (Qwen Image Layered)
- Preserves alpha channel for layer decomposition and transparency
- Uses embedded WanVAE implementation for ComfyUI v0.3.62 compatibility
- Automatically falls back to embedded version if ComfyUI's WanVAE is unavailable
- Console output shows: `[VAELoader] Using WanVAE from: Embedded` or `ComfyUI`

### Upscale Model Loader From HF

1. Add "Upscale Model Loader From HF" node to your workflow
2. Enter the Hugging Face repository name (e.g., `Phips/2xNomosUni_span_multijpg`)
3. Enter the model filename (e.g., `2xNomosUni_span_multijpg.pth`)
4. (Optional) Enter subfolder path if the model is in a subdirectory
5. Connect the output to an "Upscale Image (using Model)" node

### GGUF Model Loader From HF

1. Add "GGUF Model Loader From HF" node to your workflow
2. Enter the Hugging Face repository name (e.g., `QuantStack/Qwen-Image-Edit-2509-GGUF`)
3. Enter the GGUF filename (e.g., `Qwen-Image-Edit-2509-Q4_K_M.gguf`)
4. (Optional) Enter subfolder path if needed
5. Connect the MODEL output to compatible ComfyUI nodes

## Inputs

All loaders share the same input structure:
- **repo_name** (STRING): Hugging Face repository name
- **filename** (STRING): Model file name in the repository
- **subfolder** (STRING, optional): Subfolder path within the repository

## Outputs

- **UNET Model Loader**: MODEL output
- **CLIP Model Loader**: CLIP output

- **Upscale Model Loader**: UPSCALE_MODEL output
- **GGUF Model Loader**: MODEL output

## Example Workflows

### Qwen Image Layered Workflow
```
UNET Model Loader From HF -> ModelSamplingAuraFlow
CLIP Model Loader From HF -> CLIPTextEncode (Positive/Negative)
VAE Model Loader From HF -> VAEEncode/VAEDecode
Load Image -> KSampler -> VAEDecode -> Save Image
```

### Upscale Workflow
```
Load Image -> Upscale Model Loader From HF -> Upscale Image (using Model) -> Save Image
```

### GGUF Workflow
```
GGUF Model Loader From HF -> [Connect to compatible MODEL input nodes]
```

## Supported Model Formats
